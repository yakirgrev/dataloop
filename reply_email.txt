Dear Bob,
Glad you like our platform, it is always great to hear a positive
feedback.
As for the issue you have been experiencing, I see that most of the annotations 
you created are showing although not all of them.

For now I can suggest the following solution:
Please see the attatched list below of the items missing the annotations.
We will be more than happy with assisting you recover the
lost anotations, just let us know what to write next to each
one by editing the list and reply to this email.

Also I will keep you informed as how to make sure the annotations were saved
and we'll do our best to come up with a long term solution for you, so expect an answer from us
later on today.

Thank you for the helpful tip, I think it is 
a great idea and will be sure to move it forward to our
engineers department.

Best regards,
